(1) Simulation Tests for Known-scale Point Cloud Registration Problems:

To implement SUCOFT for known-scale registration, please:
1. open 'main_KS.m';
2. run the script 'main_KS.m' for visualized results.

(2) Simulation Tests for Unknown-scale Point Cloud Registration Problems:

To implement SUCOFT for unknown-scale registration, please:
1. open 'main_US.m';
2. run the script 'main_US.m' for visualized results.
